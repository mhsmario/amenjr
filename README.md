README

During dinner time with friends I asked if my friend consider analysing his bands lyrics to better 
understand the most frequent words and themes they use and how that might have changed over time. So I 
did a quick text mining of the band's top songs. This repo contains the text files representing each song 
as well as the source code and main findings as an HTML.

Purpose: Using R to better understand the main words and themes of a band (Amem Jr.)
